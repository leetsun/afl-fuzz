This directory is the test program for AFL fuzz.

IsTree_xxx are c programs, which are compiled from the same source file IsTree.c.
Makefile is for IsTree program.
test.xx is middle files in compiling process, using for understanding gcc process.

"count.c and count program" are from afl-fuzz.c's function named "count_bits", using for understanding this algorithm.

mylib.c and mylib.so rewrite api function "settimer", using for conceil timeout when fuzzing when gdb.
using:export LD_PRELOAD=./mylibso

The other directory are auxilay for afl running, the fuzzing command is :
    ../afl-fuzz -i cases -o output -f tc.txt IsTree_xxx tc.txt
    (export AFL_PATH=.. befor fuzzing)
